    PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a popular multiplayer online battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game was released for Microsoft Windows in March 2017, and has since been released for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android.

In PUBG, up to 100 players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons, ammunition, and other supplies while trying to survive against the other players. The game's map gradually shrinks over time, forcing players to confront each other in close quarters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

PUBG has gained a large following due to its intense and strategic gameplay, as well as its use of realistic weapons and environments. It has also inspired a number of other battle royale games and has become a popular eSport, with various tournaments and leagues held around the world.
